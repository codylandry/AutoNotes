# AutoNotes

### WIP

### Purpose

I want a system that allows me to setup a template for work notes, todos, completed tasks, etc. 

- It should allow me to make changes both manually and programatically. (cli interface)
- It should be configurable from the command line. (dotfile?) 
- It should be easily installable. (pip)
- It should support github style markdown checkboxes
